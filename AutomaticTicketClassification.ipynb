Also confirmed that I had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error, reversal of late charges, payment in full and notation that I would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which I HAVE received. This reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end. \n","\n","All subsequent payments have been made on time and as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has a {$12.00} balance due to charges made after payment in full. \n","\n","In XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX alert service that I subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from XXXX to XXXX. I opened the XXXX file which stated a late payment was reported by Chase for XXXX. I filed a dispute and in XXXX received an email from XXXX  stating the dispute had been resolved. Upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed. \n","\n","I contacted Chase XXXX Visa, explained the negative reporting, the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges. They stated that the \" Credit Bureau Unit '' was not currently open and requested I call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information. \n","\n","I followed the advice and spoke with XXXX, CBU specialist in the XXXX, MO call center. After a long period of discussion XXXX informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau. \n","\n","After requesting all notation on my file he advised I send a fax to the \" Business Office '' at ( XXXX ) XXXX but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that I could send the request to. \n","\n","I asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to XXXX customer service. \n","\n","In speaking with XXXX in customer service I believed that I was still speaking to the Credit Bureau department. I recalled all events, she confirmed the notation in the account. Additionally, I advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on XX/XX/XXXX my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all Chase accounts. I was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account I received a screen that stated that I needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbers/email that were pre-populated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information. I had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once I was able to gain access into the account I confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the DEFAULT contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information. \n","\n","I explained to her that when I tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account.

At this point SHE ADVISED ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CREDIT BUREAU DEPARTMENT and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done. I explained that I had already spoken with XXXX in that department and that I was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her. She stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to 5 days to provide a call back. \n","\n","She then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named XXXX, explained the situation and XXXX told her that there \" was nothing that he could do to assist ''. \n","\n","I have never been late with a payment across all accounts.
